        <p>
        Differential equations are mathematical tools that help us describe the world around us. They are equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives. In the realm of AI, they play a crucial role in modeling dynamic systems, such as weather patterns or stock market trends. AI can use differential equations to predict future states of these systems, making them invaluable in fields like meteorology and finance. Stay tuned as we delve deeper into this fascinating topic!
