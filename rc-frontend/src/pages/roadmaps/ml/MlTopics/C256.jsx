        <h2>C</h2>
        <p>
        C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is fast, portable and available on all platforms. 
        In the context of Machine Learning, C can be incredibly efficient, especially in areas where computation speed is critical. <br /><br />
        While it may not be as easy to use as Python or R for Machine Learning, it provides a level of control and efficiency that is hard to match.
        Stay tuned as we delve deeper into how we can leverage C in the field of Machine Learning.
