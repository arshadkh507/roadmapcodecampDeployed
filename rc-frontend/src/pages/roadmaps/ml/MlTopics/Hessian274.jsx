        <h2>Hessian</h2>
        <p>
        The Hessian is a type of matrix that's used in the world of machine learning. It's a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar function. That might sound a bit complex, but essentially, it's a way to analyze a multivariable function and find its maxima, minima, and saddle points.
<br /><br />
        In machine learning, we often use the Hessian when we're doing optimization tasks, like finding the minimum or maximum of a function. It's particularly useful when we're working with large datasets and complex models, as it can help speed up the learning process.
        <br /><br />

        So why do we use it? Well, the Hessian gives us a way to understand the curvature of a function. If we know the curvature, we can make more informed decisions about how to adjust our model's parameters during the learning process. This can lead to more accurate models, faster training times, and ultimately, better results.
