        <h2>What Is Domain Name</h2>
        <p>
          A domain name is a unique address on the internet that helps people find and access websites easily. It is like the online equivalent of a physical address for a house or a business. Just like you use an address to locate a specific place, a domain name allows you to locate a specific website.





        </p>
        <p> A domain name consists of two main parts: the actual name (such as "example") and the domain extension (such as ".com" or ".org"). When you type a domain name into a web browser, it sends a request to a special computer called a DNS (Domain Name System) server, which looks up the corresponding IP address associated with that domain name. The IP address is a series of numbers that identifies the specific location of the website's server on the internet.</p>
        <p>  In simpler terms, a domain name is like a website's unique name or identity, making it easy for people to remember and access websites without needing to remember complex strings of numbers. It plays a crucial role in helping us navigate the internet and find the websites we want to visit.</p>
