        <h2>BEM Block Element Modifier</h2>
        <p>
        BEM, which stands for Block Element Modifier, is a highly useful methodology for writing maintainable and scalable CSS. It's a naming convention that makes your CSS easier to read and understand. It also makes your styles more predictable and easier to work with. <br /> <br />
        In BEM, a Block is a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. An Element is a part of a Block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its Block. A Modifier is a property of a Block or an Element that can alter its look or behavior.<br /> <br />
        We use BEM in large-scale projects where maintainability and scalability are of high importance. It's a great way to keep your code organized and prevent styles from "leaking" out into other elements.
