        <h2>Heap</h2>
        <p>
        A heap is like a specialized tree structure where the value of each node is greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the values of its children. In programming, a heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. A max heap ensures that the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, while a min heap ensures the opposite. Heaps are commonly used for efficient priority queue implementations, where elements with higher or lower priorities can be extracted and processed quickly. They are also used in various algorithms, such as heap sort and graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.
